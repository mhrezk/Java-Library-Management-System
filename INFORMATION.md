# Java Library System

## Description

A repository designed, in Java, to simulate a system within a bookstore. The system is designed to allow for an employee to add and remove books from the database, and allows a customer to borrow and return books from the bookstore. A fee is required should the customer fail to return a borrowed book after the passage of 14 days.
